      iam: "All these makes me who I am. I code every day, I play games whenever I am not geeking stuff around or playing any of my bass guitars, and in the most unexpected moment I even may find the time to write a little something. "

      igame: "I still remember playing Prince of Persia and The Fate of Atlantis back in the 90's in a DOS computer, I was 6. Gaming has been a part of me all my life."
      igeek: "As a telecoms engineer I could be no less, gadgets and all kind of geek stuff keep me awake at night."
      iplay: "I wouldn't be who I am without music, once I bought my first bass guitar around 2006 I have not been myself again."
      iwrite: "Even though I do it for myself, writing is one of my most unknown hobbies. Who knows, maybe some day you find a book with my name printed on the cover."
